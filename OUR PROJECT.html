        <h2>ABOUT THIS PROJECT:-</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">In this project our main focus is on water recycling . Water scarcity is becoming a major issue in our country. In dry areas farmers face water scarcity & sometimes they are forced to use drain water for irrigation.
            To reduce this problem we have made an AQUA CLARIFIER which will purify or filter water at the initial level.
            This filter can be attached in every house & the waste water which is released from houses and the wate water which is released from house passes through this system & get filtered for reuse.
            As this filter is installed in every house thatâ€™s why we have also worked on its cost so that even small farmers can also install it in their houses. For this we have used some waste material.<br>
        </p>
        <h5>In order to filterate the water, We basically used three main layers:-</h5>
        <br>
        <ol type="A">
         <li>First layer= Charcoal</li>
         <li>Second layer=Sand</li>
         <li>Third layer=NaOH + CaCO3</li>
        </ol>
